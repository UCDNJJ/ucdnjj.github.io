## Summary

Single cell sequencing technologies now enable the measurement of millions of cells to build atlases, or catalogs, of cell types across tissues, species and disease (Human Cell Atlas, Tabular Muris, Allen Institute, Ren, Ecker). Recent advancements enable the measurement of multiple high-dimension modalities (e.g. RNA, epigenetics, and proteins) simultaneously from the same cell. Such multi-omic and multi-species data provides, for the first time, a more comprehensive understanding for the multi-modal markers of cellular identity that define complex systems such as the brain (Hodge et al. 2019, Yao et al. 2023, SEA-AD). 

In this competition for BICCN 2.0, we present the task of predicting cell type-specific cis-regulatory (CRE) elements using a first-of-its-kind multi-omics and multi-species atlases of cell types in the primary motor cortex. Teams will predict cell type-specific CREs by learning representations of multiple modalities measured in the same cell. Progress will reveal how species conservation of transcriptomics, epigenomics and DNA sequence features give rise to distinct cell types, as foundation for targeted exploration of cell types in brain circuitry across species.
