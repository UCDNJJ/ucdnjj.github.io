## Summary

Single cell sequencing technologies now enable the measurement of millions of cells to define atlases, or catalogs, of cell types across tissues, species and disease. Recent advancements enable the measurement of multiple high-dimension modalities (e.g. RNA and epigenomics) simultaneously from the same cell. Multi-omic and multi-species profiling, for the first time, identifies conservation in molecular features which define cell types that are part of a complex systems such as the brain (Hodge et al. 2019, Yao et al. 2023, SEA-AD). 

In this competition, for BICCN 2.0, we present the task of predicting cell type-specific cis-regulatory (CRE) enhancer elements using a first of its kind multi-omics and multi-species atlases of cell types in the primary motor cortex. Teams will predict cell type-specific enhancers by learning representations of multiple modalities measured in the same cell and then be evaluated against a collection of in-vivo experimentally screened enhancers. Progress will reveal how species conservation of transcriptomics, epigenomics and DNA sequence identifies cell type-specific molecular features, as foundation for targeted exploration of cell types in brain circuitry across species.
