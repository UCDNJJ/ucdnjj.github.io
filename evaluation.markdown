## Evaluation

Metrics for cell annotation-specific functional enhancer prediction aim to characterize how well the ranked list of enhancers correspond to experimentally validated enhancer collections.

RBO: Rank based overlap measures the enrichment of experimentally validated enhancers in the most highly ranked function enhancer predictions. Further information can be found in Webber et al. 2010.

Rank adjusted scoring (RAS): Let modelRankenhancerj,kbe the rank of enhancer for a given team where k K is the set of all cell annotations, onTargetenhanceri,k indicate experimentally validated on-target enhancers and offTargetenhanceri,kindicate experimentally validated off-target enhancers. For reference on enhancer scoring please go to our (Experimental validation)[LINK] page.

Then each model is scored as follows:
