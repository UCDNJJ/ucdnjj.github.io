We believe there are key traits of our challenge that will drive innovation:
* Modeling tasks are formally defined with clear mathematical and biological interpretation
* Easily accessible cross-species dataset are publicly available in raw and ready-to-go formats
* Rigorous quantitative metrics are defined for each task to judge model success.
* Benchmark models are provided to identify improvement over current standards.
* State-of-the-art models are ranked on a public and continuously updated leaderboard.

### Goals

Our goal is to host an open source, community driven challenge with flexible benchmarking of formalized tasks in cross-species single-cell multi-omics analysis. We are interested in providing un-baised evaluation of novel methods, for prediction of celltype-specific cis-regulatory elements, that incoperate data-driven factors including cross-species conservation of epigenetic signal as well as biological priors from domain experts.

### Hosting

Our challenge is hosted on XXX. Benchmarks are evaluated using XXX. Leaderboards are hosted on our (Results)[LINK] page. All code, method and leadership is driven by broad input from the scientific community.
