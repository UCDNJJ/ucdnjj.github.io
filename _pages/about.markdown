We are inspired by the rapid progress of machine learning methods in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and representation learning on multi-modal. These fields of machine learning have seen advances in-part due to standardized benchmark datasets used to compare model performance on well-defined computation tasks. 

Many of the machine learning methods developed for computer vision and natural language processing are extended to an analogous problem in the field of computational biology. For example, the GPT model (e.g. ChatGPT) has recently been applied to reconstructing continuous language from fMRI of people watching Disney movies. In the realm of biological sciences, DREAM challenges have spurred machine learning advances through identifying key open-problems and providing formalized competitions to the broad research community. 

With the BICCN2.0 challenge we want to provide a formalized competition to unsolved problems in computation biology applied to large-scale sequencing efforts of the brain.  

### Core Ideals

We believe there are key traits of our challenge that will drive innovation:
* Modeling tasks are formally defined with clear mathematical and biological interpretation
* Easily accessible cross-species dataset are publicly available in raw and ready-to-go formats
* Rigorous quantitative metrics are defined for each task to judge model success.
* Benchmark models are provided to identify improvement over current standards.
* State-of-the-art models are ranked on a public and continuously updated leaderboard.

### Goals

Our goal is to host an open source, community driven challenge with flexible benchmarking of formalized tasks in cross-species single-cell multi-omics analysis. We are interested in providing un-baised evaluation of novel methods, for prediction of celltype-specific cis-regulatory elements, that incoperate data-driven factors including cross-species conservation of epigenetic signal as well as biological priors from domain experts.
