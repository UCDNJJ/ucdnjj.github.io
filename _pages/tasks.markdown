This challenge is comprised of a single phase:

### Identifying functional enhancers per cell annotation

Here the goal is to define novel machine learning algorithms to predict function enhancers specific to individual cell types, using multi-modalities and species profiling of the motor cortex. The data sets provided for this task are a diverse collection of multi-omics profiles from four species (Human, Macaque, Marmoset and Mouse) that can be integrated as well as incorporated with biological priors.

Teams will optimize models that provide a ranked list of genomic regions (enhancers) for each cell annotation. The predictions will be evaluated against a large collection of experimentally validated enhancers.
