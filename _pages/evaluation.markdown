### Overview

Teams will be evaluated based on the ranked ordering of enhancers that have been screened in enhancer AVVs in-vivo at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. 

## Validation data

</p>

Each enhancer AAV in our collection has been scored to determine specificity of the enhancer element with respect a target cell type as well as density and intensity of cell labeling. 

Briefly, each enhancer is screened as follows: 

* Enhancer element is cloned upstream of a minimal beta-globin promoter driving flouresence protein SYFP2 and packaged in PHP.eB-serotype viruses that enable crossing of the blood brain barrier.
* Mice were injected retro-orbitally (RO) with the enhancer AAV.
* Scoring of flouresence in brain slices to define specificity of enhancer element.

In total we have experimentally validated **hundreds** of enhancer elements selected to be specific for a given cortical cell population. 

### Metrics

Metrics for evaluating cell type-specific functional enhancer prediction aim to characterize how well the ranked list of enhancers correspond to experimentally validated enhancer collections.

Details coming soon.
